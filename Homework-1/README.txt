INTRODUCTION

In this assignment the class was tasked to use publicly available visualization
tools to construct some basic visualization of datasets provided.  Students
could select two visualization tools from the following list:
      - This visualization toolkit (VTK)
      - Slicer
      - Matlab
      - Data-Driven Documents (D3)
      - Tableau Public
      - Processing
      - WebGL
      - OpenGL

This exercise was designed to assist students in determining whether these tools
 would be suitable for developing course pro are due later in the semester.

INCLUDED FILES

The repository uploaded to the GitHub site consists of the following:
      - Tableau Chart_Type of Patient Encounter Grouped by Age Gender.png
      - Tableau Chart_Number and Type of Patient Encounter By Quarter.png
      - README.txt
      - hmwk1.html
      - Hmwk1_Tool Overview Report.doc


CONFIGURATION

The html file included in this submission is designed to run with minimal
configuration.  The source references a copy of the "data2ehrSample.csv" file
that is stored on a Google docs share.  Using any web browser, it should be
possible to simply open the file from the local file system or from a url.  The
code compiles, but did not produce the results anticipated for Images 1 and 2
prior to the posted deadline.

STEPS USED TO PRODUCE IMAGES

Images 1 and 2 were produced using D3.  Javascript code was written to process
the data2ehrSample.csv file provided.  The code did not produce the desired
images.

Images 3 and 4 were produced using Tableau.  The following steps were used:
  Step 1:  A academic license for Tableau was obtained.
  Step 2:  The "data2ehrSample.csv" file was read into Tableau's Data Source
           Conntector.  This process was intuitive.
  Step 3:  Tableau's Datasheets are very similar to Microsoft Excel Worksheets.
           Datatypes within the Data Sheet Field layout were separated into
           either "Dimensions" or "Measures".
  Step 4:  Tableau's user interface allows the user to drag and drop
           representative icons for Datasheet fields onto a Workspace
           designed to allow experimentation with different chart types.
           The palette of options allows configuration of Color, size, text
           options, tooltips, fonts, and layouts using several canned/curated
           chartypes.
  Step 5:  Completed images for both Image 3 and 4 are provided.
